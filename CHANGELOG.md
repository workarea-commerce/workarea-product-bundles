Workarea Package Products 3.3.1 (2019-04-16)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Fix pricing method being private

    This isn't private on the base `Storefront::ProductViewModel` so it
    shouldn't be private in this view model.

    Ben Crouse

*   Require Workarea 3.4 to fix testing dependency

    This plugin overrides a test needed in v3.4 that won't pass in earlier

Workarea Package Products 3.2.1 (2018-10-03)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Prevent Exception When Adding "Displayable When Out Of Stock" Product in Family to Cart

    Products using the `DisplayableWhenOutOfStock` policy which were not
    actually available to sell caused an exception when a user attempted to
    add them to cart. Workarea now prevents this error by ensuring that all
    order items passed into the `AddPackageToCart` command are actually in
    the order (since inventory checks may have removed items due to being
    out of stock) before rendering order items to the screen in the cart.

*   Compact filters in seeds

    If the products are created from other sample data where there isn't any
    color or size filters, the seeds would create a filter where the value
    was `[nil]`, breaking analytics seeds.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Add ids to fields to prevent duplicate ids, update template test for plugin friendliness

    PACKAGEPDP-45
    Matt Duffy

*   Fix packaged generic product inline refresh

    When the generic product template refreshes itself upon a SKU change, it
    was replacing the `.product-details` element on the page with one that
    didn't include a `data-packaged-product-id`, thus causing the JS module
    that adds packaged products in a family to the cart to think that the
    item was not actually selected. We're now wrapping the
    `.product-details` for each packaged product with a
    `.packaged-product-details` element that includes the
    `data-packaged-product-id`, ensuring that the ID will always be on the
    page right after the checkbox.

Workarea Package Products 3.1.2 (2017-10-03)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   Fix pageview event firing for package products.

    The package product was being passed into the analytics helper for each product within the package.
    This caused the pageview event to be fired on the package product the same number of times as products within the package.
    Products within the package are now sending the appropriate product to the analytics helper
